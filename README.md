Galaxy Codex
============

Galaxy Communities Dock (Galaxy CoDex) stores resources for Galaxy users, community contributors and community members.

Currently, we have two main resources:

1. **Galaxy Community Catalog**: for tools, training & workflows. The catalog is automatically updated every week and is updated for all tools, workflows and tutorials, as well as community-specific catalogs.
You can access the [complete catalogue](https://galaxyproject.github.io/galaxy_codex/).

2. **Galaxy Labs**: (led by Galaxy Australia!), a centralised webpage that enables communities to rapidly aggregate, curate, integrate, display, and launch relevant tools, workflows, and training on different Galaxy servers.
For example, you can access the [microgalaxy lab on the EU instance](https://microbiology.usegalaxy.eu/).

To create community specific resources with the codex, you can find the information in the [communities readme file](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex/communities).


# Vocabulary
- **Galaxy Community**: A community is a group of motivated people who have a common topic they would like to develop resources for.
- **Galaxy Community of Practice and Special Interest Groups** : In Galaxy, the term Special Interest Group (SIG) refers to a dedicated scientific community that crosses individual lab boundaries and wants to collaborate, share resources, support each other, and/or collectively advocate on a given theme. SIGs were devleopped for many communities, you can find the list of SIG in the [SIG Directory](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig).
To develop a Special Interest Group for you community, yoyu can follow this [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/community/tutorials/community_content/tutorial.html), but we recommend development of labs now.
- **Galaxy Server**: Computational power/infrastructure that a Galaxy instance uses, such as usegalaxy.eu or usegalaxy.org
- **Subdomain**: General term for Galaxy instance aimed at specific community (like microbiome or single-cell). Uses a specific Galaxy server.
- **Galaxy Lab**: Specific style of UI-informed subdomain, Galaxy Australia built a new method for generating the main and tool panels, known as a Galaxy Lab.
