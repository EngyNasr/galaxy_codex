Galaxy Codex
============

Galaxy Communities Dock (Galaxy CoDex) stores resources for Galaxy users, community contributors and community members.

Currently, we have two main resources:

1. **Galaxy Community Catalog**: for tools, training (tutorials) & workflows. 

    Several catalogs are available: the complete catalog and the community-specific catalogs. Each catalog is semi-automatically updated every week.

    Check the [complete catalogue](https://galaxyproject.github.io/galaxy_codex/).

2. **Galaxy Labs** (led by Galaxy Australia!): a centralised webpage that enables communities to rapidly aggregate, curate, integrate, display, and launch relevant tools, workflows, and training on different Galaxy servers.

For example, you can access the [Microbiology Lab on the EU instance](https://microbiology.usegalaxy.eu/).

**To create community specific resources, check the guide in the [`communities` folder `README` file](communities).**

- **Galaxy Community of Practice and Special Interest Groups** : Special Interest Group (SIG) were devleopped for many communities, you can find the list of SIGs in the [SIG Directory](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig).
To develop a Special Interest Group for you community, you can follow this [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/community/tutorials/community_content/tutorial.html), but we recommend development of labs now.

- **Subdomain**: General term for Galaxy instance aimed at specific community (like microbiome or single-cell). Uses a specific Galaxy server.
